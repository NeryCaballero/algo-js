// Exercise 4.3
// By reusing the function rand10() created in Exercise 2, write a function named multiRand(n) 
// that returns an array of n numbers between 1 and 10. You should not modify anything in rand10() to achieve this.

// Write a documentation for the multiRand(n) function.

// Use that function to create a program that will ask the number of random numbers to generate then display that same number of random numbers.

    for (let i=1; i <= n; i++) {        // i is my counter, n is the input, as long as counter is less or equal than the input
        let x = rand10();               // let x be a random number generated by rand10()
        a.push(x);                      // push that random number into array a
